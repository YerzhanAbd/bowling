# Solution for Bowling Kata, implementing TDD with CPP + Doctests
Assumptions:
- Not checking for valid input, i.e. negative valued PINS
- Player can roll infinitely many times, but the programm counts up to 12 rolls.
- For strike, I add 10 points right after the roll, and then the bonus points afterwards 
- We count points based on rolls, not on frames.
